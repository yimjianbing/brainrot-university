Title: World War I
Description: World War I was a massive global conflict that went down between two main crews, the Allies and the Central Powers. The fight was mostly in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific. This war saw some crazy new tech like tanks, planes, and chemical weapons. It was one of the deadliest wars ever, with around 30 million soldiers getting hurt or killed, and another 8 million civilians dying from war-related stuff and genocide. All the movement of people during the war also helped spread the Spanish flu, which was a total pandemic disaster.
